		<p>The historian Herodotus (484 – c. 425 BC) and the scholar Callimachus of Cyrene (c. 305–240 BC), at the Museum of Alexandria, made early lists of seven wonders. Their writings have not survived, except as references.

The classic seven wonders were:

Great Pyramid of Giza, El Giza, Egypt the only one that still exists.
Colossus of Rhodes, in Rhodes, on the Greek island of the same name.
Hanging Gardens of Babylon, in Babylon, near present-day Hillah, Babil province, in Iraq.
Lighthouse of Alexandria, in Alexandria, Egypt.
Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, in Halicarnassus, Achaemenid Empire, modern day Turkey.
Statue of Zeus at Olympia, in Olympia, Greece.
Temple of Artemis at Ephesus, in Ephesus (near the modern town of Selçuk in present-day Turkey).
Lists from other eras
In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some writers wrote their own lists with names such as Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Middle Ages, Seven Wonders of the Medieval Mind, and Architectural Wonders of the Middle Ages. However, it is unlikely that these lists originated in the Middle Ages, because the word "medieval" was not invented until the Enlightenment-era, and the concept of a Middle Age did not become popular until the 16th century. Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable refers to them as "later list[s]",[2] suggesting the lists were created after the Middle Ages.

Many of the structures on these lists were built much earlier than the Medieval Ages but were well known.[3][4]

Typically representative are:[2][3][5][6]

Catacombs of Kom el Shoqafa located in Alexandria, Egypt.
Colosseum in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy.
Great Wall of China built across the historical northern borders of China.
Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, Turkey.
Leaning Tower of Pisa in Pisa, Italy.
Porcelain Tower of Nanjing located on the south bank of external Qinhuai River in Nanjing, People's Republic of China.
Stonehenge in Wiltshire, England.
Other sites sometimes included on such lists:

Cairo Citadel[7] is a medieval Islamic fortification in Cairo, Egypt.
Cluny Abbey[8] in Cluny, Saône-et-Loire, France.
Ely Cathedral[9] in Ely, Cambridgeshire, England.
Taj Mahal[10] on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the India city of Agra.</p>
